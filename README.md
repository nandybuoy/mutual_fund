# mutual_fund
Set up a database (MySQL or MongoDB) to store monthly data of 10 mutual funds of your choice (try to optimize the format/schema to store this data). Write a query/ formulate an API (using node, python or R) to calculate 1/2/3/7- and 10-year annualized return of each mutual fund, store that in the database and showcase that using a UI form.
